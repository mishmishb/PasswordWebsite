            <br>
            <h2>A study conducted in 2016 (Shen, et al.) demonstrated that the average password length
                is now over 9 characters. While this sounds good, an incredible 83% of the passwords
                studied were derived from meaningful data.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h2>The use of words and names comes from a need to remember increasingly long passwords.
                The irony is that we need to make our passwords longer so they are more secure, but then
                to remember long passwords we need to use words, which undoes the extra security!
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h1>However, there is another way: the mnemonic sentence technique</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>This technique involves choosing a memorable phrase (the longer the better) and taking the first letter
                of each word to make a mnemonic device. Certain letters should then be replaced with numbers and symbols
                to create a seemingly random sequence.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h2>For example: "The person who uses this technique will surely have a better password!" could become
                "tPwuttwsh4bp!"
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h1>Try running your passwords through the strength checker below, and then compare that to
                using the mnemonic technique described. Don't worry, everything is client side so no information
                is sent to a server.
